# Polarizing movies
Let's all agree that Pixar's *Inside Out* is great! At least that's what its IMDB ratings suggest. IMDB and similarly Rotten Tomatoes, are making it pretty easy for us to find great movies like *Inside Out* with their rankings (see [Top 250 on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top)). It is likewise easy to find movies that are not worthy of anyone's time, but could be interesting to take a quick look at to see how bad a movie can be -- you could checkout [The 40 Worst Movies of All Time](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls076596691/). 

But then, there are those "love it or hate it" types of movies. Those movies can be hard to find among the usual movie rankings: their average scores are likely to be mediocre, and therefore hidden among those other ones that most people agree are just, yes, mediocre. We need a way to rank what movies are the most polarizing, which we can then use as a starting point to uncover the actual hidden gems that are worth watching.

I will now present you with exactly that: a ranking of movies on IMDB by how polarizing they are to viewers.
