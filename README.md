# Polarizing movies
Let's all agree that Pixar's Inside Out is great! This at least what its IMDB ratings suggest, as almost voting users give it a high rating. IMDB and similarly Rotten Tomatoes is making it pretty easy for us to find great movies like Inside Out with their ranking lists -- see for example [Top 250 on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top). It is likewise easy to find movies that are not worthy of anyones time, but could be interesting to take a quick peak at to see how bad a movie can be -- you could checkout [The 40 Worst Movies of All Time](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls076596691/)! But there are those movies that tend to divide people in those who love them and those who hate them. Those movies can be hard to find on the usual movie ranks as their average score would be mediocre, and therefore, hidden between the movies that most people agree are just, yes, mediocre! We need a rank of the movies that polarize people the most, and then see if there are some hidden gems worth watching in that list. 

I will here bring you just exactly that: A rank of movies on IMDB by how polarizing they are to people! 

So clone the repository or head over to a live code instance on __[binder](http://mybinder.org/repo/keldLundgaard/Polarizing_movies)__, and please let me know if you happen to watch any of the listed movies because of this.

Happy movie watching.
